	<h2>Biodiversity</h2>
	<p>To demonstrate my knowledge of biodiversity I compared my two succulents. They are both meant to survive in a hot,
		dry environment but take very different approaches. At the same time they do share similarities.
	</p>
	<p>Differences: One succulent, Snazz, has a bowl shape and leaves with a pointed tip. Water can fall into this bowl 
		and drain into the roots. The other, Ozzy, has long leaves that water can flow down stem-like structures to reach 
		its roots. People have commented they look like "Shrek-ears". The shades of green on both succulents is also very 
		different.Snazz's propogated leaf appeared to make more progress at first, but 
		just recently Ozzy's leaf began to have the longest roots.
	</p>
	<p>Similarities: both succulents and their propogated leaves have grown very slowly in the Oregon sun. Thankfully, 
		they recieve enough sunlight to stay alive. Both plants must be watered very infrequently as too
		much water can kill them. They also share the quality of stiff, thick, plastic-like leaves to retain water
