	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>My description skills are shown by this media piece because it reflects my ability to take accurate data.
		This page in particular displays images, which are incredibly helpful for description. They are like
		sketches in their visual representation, however they are not biased by the artist's perspective. Taking many
		quality photos of a location through the five perspectives is very useful for remembering details about a 
		site.

	<p>First Impression: The ground is particularly moist today

	<p>Ground Level: I hadn't noticed these white growths on the bottom of the raised bed. The biodiversity becomes much more 
		apparent at a low level.

	<p>Eye Level: It's easy to get lost in the sea of green. The plant mass has increased dramatically in the last month.

	<p>Overhead: The fence and house do not offer much overhead coverage, but do offer protection from the wind. It is still cold, but not the dangerous combination of severe cold and wind.

	<p>Final View: When I first arrived here I thought these beds were barren and incapable of life. These plants showed me that was far from the truth.
