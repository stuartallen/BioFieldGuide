	<h2>Exploration</h2>
	<p>
		To demonstrate my exploration skills I included my seven steps media. A friend and I ventured to my backyard
		to explore the area. It is shocking to me just how much this area has changed since the beginning of the year
		with minimal human interaction. This was one of the first times I really looked at the area even though I live so close to
		it. This shows that exploration can happen anywhere, and it is much more involved than just a simple scan.
	</p>
	<p> Me and my friend Rudy who is also in the class decided to explore my backyard. It sounds silly, but I don't know 
			much about the organisms and communities in it. There are raised beds, but the soil is very tough so I assumed not much 
			would be back there.

	<p>
		In order to scan the backyard, we flipped over my friends kiddie pool. We did not find any new organisms, but we did find 
		some bagged soil that is available to us. We also looked closely on the vegetation to find ants and even a white epiphyte growing 
		on some of the leaves of the plants outside the raised bed. There are other organisms we obeserved indirectly by finding cracked 
		nut shells in the garden, and even slightly under the house.

		In terms of climate, Corvallis lies in a temperate rainforest due to the moderately cold temperatures and the bountiful rainfall. 
		It is moist even if the soil in the backyard is hard. In terms of weather, today it is 57 degrees and 96% humidity.
	</p>
	<p>
		The land in my backyard is flat with hard dirt. There are raised beds about 4 inches higher than the rest of the ground. It is a 
		small area that is fenced in 3 directions from my neighbors, but small organisms could travel under or over the fence.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the middle of the raised beds is the focal point of a community of plants and mosses of different species. Cracked shells suggested 
		a squirrel or other nut eating organism chose to eat their food here. Inside a bucket of rain water, there was slightly green coloration 
		suggesting evidence of micro-life.

	<p>If observed closely, it is clear that plants offer food for ants and other insects. It is not unlikely that these plants help fuel a 
		nearby ant colony. Based on the discarded shells, it is possible the plants and the house itself offered security for a small organism 
		to eat. I have seen house cats around this area that could prey on a small organism if it was unprotected while eating. It is also worth 
		noting the soil gets softer and wetter with the presence of the plants and mosses. Almost all of the plants in the raised beds would be 
		considered weeds, but they are actually doing some of the work that would cost money and labor to fix with soil.
	</p>
	<p>
		From a conservation biology lens, this space could be made more useful to the surrounding ecosystem. With the help of the weeds present, 
		breaking up the soil into a softer and more habitable garden could lay the groundwork for flowers and other plants. More plants could turn 
		this area into a greater carbon sink, doing a small part in the fight to reduce climate change. At the same time, this would help pollinators 
		like the European honey bee as well as native bee species. In my kitchen, I was gifted far too many mugs and plastic straws by the last residents. 
		With some research bee habitats could be set up with these materials or similar ones. I would need to do more research to make sure this would 
		not attract so many bees or wasps as to make the area hazardous to residents and children.
