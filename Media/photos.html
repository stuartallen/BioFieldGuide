	<h2>Photos</h2>
	<p>To demonstrate my ability to effectively communicate through photos I used the media piece showing seasonal
		changes. Many of these changes had effects on my human lifestyle. This isn't usually considered part of nature
		human life is in fact natural. Some images may seem mundane as well, but it is possible to derive meaning from 
		them about changes in weather and environment.
	</p>
	<p>This change you will have to look closely for. The bearings on my skateboard have begun to suffer as a result of 
		rain. When bearings on a skateboard become water damaged, they are referred to as water logged. As a human reaction 
		to a seasonal event, in this case the rain, I had to purchase new bearings in order to keep skating. The person at 
		the store also told me another more proactive step might be to spin my wheels or bonk the skateboard on the ground 
		after riding through wet terrain. This is why skating is more popular in Oregon during the summer and late spring 
		seasons.

	<p>This image is of an apple ready to harvest during the fall I took with my girlfriend about two weeks ago. Some crops 
		become ripe only during the fall just like this fruit. It doesn't look like an apple that'd be in the store because 
		the farmer did not take the steps to prevent these spots. There is still nothing wrong with the fruit, this is just 
		what some refer to as "apple sauce" apples.

	<p>This photo was taken as part of a form check video. I decided this would be nice to include because of the implications 
		of daylight. It is so dark that light from the inside of a building creates a mirror against a window. This was taken 
		around 7:30pm, a time during the summer that would be almost as the afternoon. Instead it is now incredibly dark. For 
		endothermic species that are awake during the day, it is nice to have shelter towards the fall and winter in order to 
		preserve warmth. However, for nocturnal mammals like rodents and bats, this extended darkness may present an advantage 
		because there are more productive hours availabe.
